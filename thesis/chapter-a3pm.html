        <h3>Self-annotation of Occam Delta XV by Quatuor Bozzini</h3>
        Self-annotation by Quatuor Bozzini of their performance of Occam Delta XV composed by Eliane Radigue.
        Members of the Quatuor were asked to annotate one of their performance (recorded at Ircam) by indicating which 
        member they were listening to (including themselves) at each time. This video show an excerpt of 
        the animation reconstructed from their annotations along with the music.
        The analysis of this experiment was published in the following article: <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/10298649231203641">Majeau-Bettez, E., Golvet, A., & Canonne, C. (2024). Tracking auditory attention in group performances: A case study on
        Éliane Radigue’s Occam Delta XV. Musicae Scientiae, 28(2), 308-330.</a>
